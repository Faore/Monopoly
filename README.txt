3) Strengths and weaknesses of the assignment

Our use of Gradle, IntelliJ IDE, and GitHub greatly improved the workflow for PA4.
These tools were among our greatest strengths in the project, because they allowed us to 
work efficiently. Each member of the group could track the progress of the project, and 
correct or improve code written by the other members. Another one of our strengths was communication.
We clearly definied our goals ahead of time, such as adding Chance/Community Chest cards and creating a custom theme.
The greatest takeaway from the project was that Software Design is just as important as coding itself. 
Having an effective plan for completing the poject early meant refactoring and testing was simpler.
This is because our project went beyond just working, it followed appropriate coding practices, such as removing code smell.
The only weaknesses I can think of for the project was that we could have done some of the work for PA4 in PA3.
For example, a coverage tool could have been useful in PA3.
Overall, I think we did a great job working as a team to split up the work for PA4. We used resources from 
in class as well as online to create a funcitonal and maintainable Monopoly Game.
This experience will help all of us while coding in a team environment.
